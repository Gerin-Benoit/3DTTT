# Shifts Challege

This repository contains data readers and examples for the three tracks of the Shifts Dataset and the [Shifts Challenge](https://research.yandex.com/shifts). 

The Shifts Dataset contains curated and labelled examples of real, 'in-the-wild' distributional shift across three large-scale tasks. Specifically, it contains a tabular weather prediction task, machine translation, and Vehicle Motion Prediction. Dataset shift is ubiquitous in all of these tasks and modalities. The dataset,  assessment metrics and benchmark results are detailed in our associated paper: [Shifts: A Dataset of Real Distributional Shift Across Multiple Large-Scale Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07455.pdf)

### Weather Prediction

The Shifts Weather Prediction Dataset  is released under [CC BY NC SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode) license. This dataset was constructed by combining features from publicly available weather prediction services and models. Specifically, we combined data from [NOAA/NWS servers](https://www.weather.gov/disclaimer), data generated by WRF model from [NCAR/UCAR](https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF/blob/master/LICENSE.txt),  and data from [Meteorological Service of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/transparency/terms.html).  Ground station readings were taken from [NOAA] (https://www.weather.gov/disclaimer). The data was cleaned and features standardized.

## Download links

As the [Shifts Challenge](https://research.yandex.com/shifts) is currently underway, we are only releasing the full training and development sets of the **canonical partition** for all tasks of the Shift Dataset, as detailed in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07455.pdf). Evaluation data without ground-truth labels or metadata will be released on **October 17th 2021**. The evaluation data labels and ground-truth predictions, as well as the full Shifts Dataset, will become availabe on **November 1st 2021**, after the Shifts Challenge concludes.

**By downloading the Shifts Dataset, you automatically agree to the licenses described above.**

### Weather Prediction

Canonical parition of the training, development and evaluation data can be downloaded [here](https://storage.yandexcloud.net/yandex-research/shifts/weather/canonical-partitioned-dataset.tar). The full dataset can be downloaded [here](https://storage.yandexcloud.net/yandex-research/shifts/weather/full-dataset.tar).  Baseline models can be downloaded [here](https://storage.yandexcloud.net/yandex-research/shifts/weather/baseline-models.tar).

The weather and motion prediction data should be as simple to load as the development data. 

### Machine Translation

The training data for this task is the [WMT'20 En-Ru](http://www.statmt.org/wmt20/translation-task.html) dataset can be downloaded [here](https://storage.yandexcloud.net/yandex-research/shifts/translation/train-data.tar), the development data can be downloaded [here](https://storage.yandexcloud.net/yandex-research/shifts/translation/dev-data.tar) and the evaluation data can be downloaded [here](https://storage.yandexcloud.net/yandex-research/shifts/translation/eval-data.tar) All data is automatically downloaded via the scripts provided [here](https://github.com/yandex-research/shifts/tree/main/translation). Baseline models can be downloaded [here](https://storage.yandexcloud.net/yandex-research/shifts/translation/baseline-models.tar).

A description of how to process the evaluation data for the translation track is provided [here](https://github.com/yandex-research/shifts/tree/main/translation).

### Motion Prediction

Canonical parition of the training and development data can be downloaded [here](https://storage.yandexcloud.net/yandex-research/shifts/sdc/canonical-trn-dev-data.tar). The canonical parition of the evaluation data can be downloaded [here](https://storage.yandexcloud.net/yandex-research/shifts/sdc/canonical-eval-data.tar).
