### Weather Prediction

The Shifts Weather Prediction Dataset  is released under [CC BY NC SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode) license. This dataset was constructed by combining features from publicly available weather prediction services and models. Specifically, we combined data from [NOAA/NWS servers](https://www.weather.gov/disclaimer), data generated by WRF model from [NCAR/UCAR](https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF/blob/master/LICENSE.txt),  and data from [Meteorological Service of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/transparency/terms.html).  Ground station readings were taken from [NOAA] (https://www.weather.gov/disclaimer). The data was cleaned and features standardized.
